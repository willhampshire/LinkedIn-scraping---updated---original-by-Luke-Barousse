# Modified LinkedIn data scraping script by Luke Barousse

Luke's scraping script wasn't working for my browser, perhaps due to date and region. I have therefore modified it so that it will. Please follow Luke's guide.

I have included my version of chromedriver.exe. Python version 3.11.

#Disclaimer

NOTICE: The use of robots or other automated means to access LinkedIn without the express permission of LinkedIn is STRICTLY PROHIBITED.
IMPORTANT NOTE: LinkedIn will BLOCK you from searching if you are scraping too much data and/or you don't have permission.

#Additional libraries
- Numpy v1.25.2
- Icecream v2.1.3 (excellent debugging print statement upgrade)
